# Install

## 1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

create a `.env.local` at the root of the app

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

```

## 2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## 3. DEVELOPMENT

Once you installed all the dependencies and packages you will be able to run these commands available in `package.json` by using `yarn dev`, `yarn build` or `yarn start`

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs next build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server
