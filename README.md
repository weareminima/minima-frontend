# Front end scaffold

This is a project template which could be used to the creation of new projects. Some of the features included are:

- Based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as CSS Framework
- Reusable components such as forms, modals, icons, and other most use components
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) already configured
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as testing client
- git workflow and hooks
- editorconfig and code style based on [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) also available and configured

## Getting Started

Check our [documentation](https://minima-docs.vercel.app/?path=/story/intro--page).

### Quick start

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

First, we recommend to read the guideline about [how to use Vercel](https://vizzuality.github.io/frontismos/docs/guidelines/vercel/).

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
